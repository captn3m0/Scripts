# scripts

This lives in my `~/projects/scripts` directory and is added to my `$PATH`. Not a lot of this is used, but I leave them in here, just in case they are helpful to someone. Scripts are in various languages, including Bash, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Perl. This also collects helper scripts I've found on the Internet (Labelled `third-party`)
